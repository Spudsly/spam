There are a few caveats. These spam macros are meant to be the proptotypical 2 key in the "/bcaa //keypress 2" style of control.
They are meant to be generally useful but are geared towards players in T10+
At the moment they are meant to be used in specific ways, for instance the SK one is geared about a SK with defensive aug, the warrior one is my "tank" one.

Two things to replace: In the warrior one I have my epic 3.0 in a weapon called "lost sands", replace those words with the name of the weapon 
you keep the 3.0 in (or go get lost sands from T9)

The shaman has several DPS boost casts that are group targets. In this case I target "Rubette"'s group, so replace that with someone in a group you want to get hit
with grudge, kraken and champion.

There are almost certainly bugs and I'm happy actively looking for feedback. I try to limit the size to avoid bloat and thus slower response times but it's a bit inevitable.

If you find any one of these keys lowers a classes performance please let me know.
